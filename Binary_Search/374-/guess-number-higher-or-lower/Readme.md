<p>We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:</p>

<p>I pick a number from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>. You have to guess which number I picked.</p>

<p>Every time you guess a wrong number, I will tell you whether the number I picked is <strong>higher</strong> or <strong>lower</strong> than your guess.</p>

<p>You call a pre-defined API <code>guess(int num)</code>, which returns:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>-1</code> if the picked number is lower than <code>num</code></li>
  <li><code>1</code> if the picked number is higher than <code>num</code></li>
  <li><code>0</code> if <code>num</code> is the picked number</li>
</ul>

<p>Return <em>the number that I picked</em>.</p>
